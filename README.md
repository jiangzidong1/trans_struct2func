# trans_struct2func
Attention based translation from structural to functional MRI.

This project is based on neural machine translation model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473). Here, we try to find an alignment between structural and functional MRI features. Structural features are loading coefficients obtained from ICA, while functional features are dynamic functional connectivity states (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158214000953).

# How to run
